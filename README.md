# E-Commerce With Admin Panel



## Shopping cart

Logged-in users can have their shopping carts saved to their profiles as they shop. This way they can continue shopping at a later date or on another device. When not logged in, the cart can be saved to local storage and synced to Payload on the next login. This works by maintaining a `cart` field on the `user`:

```ts
{
  name: 'cart',
  label: 'Shopping Cart',
  type: 'object',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'items',
      label: 'Items',
      type: 'array',
      fields: [
        // product, quantity, etc
      ]
    },
    // other metadata like `createdOn`, etc
  ]
}
```

## Stripe

Payload itself handles no currency exchange. All payments are processed and billed using [Stripe](https://stripe.com). This means you must have access to a Stripe account via an API key, see [Connect Stripe](#connect-stripe) for how to get one. When you create a product in Payload that you wish to sell, it must be connected to a Stripe product by selecting one from the field in the product's sidebar, see [Products](#products) for more details. Once set, data is automatically synced between the two platforms in the following ways:

1. Stripe to Payload using [Stripe Webhooks](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks):
   - `product.created`
   - `product.updated`
   - `price.updated`

1. Payload to Stripe using [Payload Hooks](https://payloadcms.com/docs/hooks/overview):
   - `user.create`

For more details on how to extend this functionality, see the the official [Payload Stripe Plugin](https://github.com/payloadcms/plugin-stripe).

### Connect Stripe

To integrate with Stripe, follow these steps:

1. You will first need to create a [Stripe](https://stripe.com) account if you do not already have one.
1. Retrieve your [Stripe API keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys) and paste them into your `env`:
   ```bash
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
   ```
1. In another terminal, listen for webhooks (optional):
   ```bash
   stripe login # follow the prompts
   yarn stripe:webhooks
   ```
1. Paste the given webhook signing secret into your `env`:
   ```bash
   STRIPE_WEBHOOKS_SIGNING_SECRET=
   ```
1. Reboot Payload to ensure that Stripe connects and the webhooks are registered.

## Checkout

A custom endpoint is opened at `POST /api/create-payment-intent` which initiates the checkout process. This endpoint totals your cart and creates a [Stripe Payment Intent](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-intents). The total price is recalculated on the server to ensure accuracy and security, and once completed, passes the `client_secret` back in the response for your front-end to finalize the payment. Once the payment has succeeded, an [Order](#orders) will be created in Payload with a `stripePaymentIntentID`. Each purchased product will be recorded to the user's profile, and the user's cart will be automatically cleared.

## Paywall

Products can optionally restrict access to content or digital assets behind a paywall. This will require the product to be purchased before it's data and resources are accessible. To do this, a `purchases` field is maintained on each user to track their purchase history:

```ts
{
  name: 'purchases',
  label: 'Purchases',
  type: 'array',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'product',
      label: 'Product',
      type: 'relationship',
      relationTo: 'products',
    },
    // other metadata like `createdOn`, etc
  ]
}
```

Then, a `paywall` field is added to the `product` with `read` access control set to check for associated purchases. Every time a user requests a product, this will only return data to those who have purchased it:

```ts
{
  name: 'paywall',
  label: 'Paywall',
  type: 'blocks',
  access: {
    read: checkUserPurchases,
  },
  fields: [
    // assets
  ]
}
```

## Layout Builder

Create unique product and page layouts for any type fo content using a powerful layout builder. This template comes pre-configured with the following layout building blocks:

- Hero
- Content
- Media
- Call To Action
- Archive

Each block is fully designed and built into the front-end website that comes with this template. See [Website](#website) for more details.

## Draft Preview

All pages and products are draft-enabled so you can preview them before publishing them to your website. To do this, these collections use [Versions](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/collections#versions) with `drafts` set to `true`. This means that when you create a new page or product, it will be saved as a draft and will not be visible on your website until you publish it. This also means that you can preview your draft before publishing it to your website. To do this, we automatically format a custom URL which redirects to your front-end to securely fetch the draft version of your content.

Since the front-end of this template is statically generated, this also means that pages and products will need to be regenerated as changes are made to published documents. To do this, we use an `afterChange` hook to regenerate the front-end when a document has changed and its `_status` is `published`.

For more details on how to extend this functionality, see the official [Draft Preview Example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/draft-preview).

## SEO

This template comes pre-configured with the official [Payload SEO Plugin](https://github.com/payloadcms/plugin-seo) for complete SEO control from the admin panel. All SEO data is fully integrated into the front-end website that comes with this template. See [Website](#website) for more details.

## Redirects

If you are migrating an existing site or moving content to a new URL, you can use the `redirects` collection to create a proper redirect from old URLs to new ones. This will ensure that proper request status codes are returned to search engines and that your users are not left with a broken link. This template comes pre-configured with the official [Payload Redirects Plugin](https://github.com/payloadcms/plugin-redirects) for complete redirect control from the admin panel. All redirects are fully integrated into the front-end website that comes with this template. See [Website](#website) for more details.

## Website

This template includes a beautifully designed, production-ready front-end built with the [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org), served right alongside your Payload app in a single Express server. This makes is so that you can deploy both apps simultaneously and host them together. If you prefer a different front-end framework, this pattern works for any framework that supports a custom server. If you prefer to host your website separately from Payload, you can easily [Eject](#eject) the front-end out from this template to swap in your own, or to use it as a standalone CMS. For more details, see the official [Custom Server Example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/custom-server).

Core features:

- [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org)
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com)

### Cache

Although Next.js includes a robust set of caching strategies out of the box, Payload Cloud proxies and caches all files through Cloudflare using the [Official Cloud Plugin](https://github.com/payloadcms/plugin-cloud). This means that Next.js caching is not needed and is disabled by default. If you are hosting your app outside of Payload Cloud, you can easily reenable the Next.js caching mechanisms by removing the `no-store` directive from all fetch requests in `./src/app/_api` and then removing all instances of `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` from pages files, such as `./src/app/(pages)/[slug]/page.tsx`. For more details, see the official [Next.js Caching Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/caching).

### Eject

If you prefer another front-end framework or would like to use Payload as a standalone CMS, you can easily eject the front-end from this template. To eject, simply run `yarn eject`. This will uninstall all Next.js related dependencies and delete all files and folders related to the Next.js front-end. It also removes all custom routing from your `server.ts` file and updates your `eslintrc.js`.

> Note: Your eject script may not work as expected if you've made significant modifications to your project. If you run into any issues, compare your project's dependencies and file structure with this template. See [./src/eject](./src/eject) for full details.

For more details on how setup a custom server, see the official [Custom Server Example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/custom-server).

##  Development

To spin up this example locally, follow the [Quick Start](#quick-start). Then [Connect Stripe](#connect-stripe) to enable payments, and [Seed](#seed) the database with a few products and pages.

### Docker

Alternatively, you can use [Docker](https://www.docker.com) to spin up this template locally. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Follow [steps 1 and 2 from above](#development), the docker-compose file will automatically use the `.env` file in your project root
1. Next run `docker-compose up`
1. Follow [steps 4 and 5 from above](#development) to login and create your first admin user

That's it! The Docker instance will help you get up and running quickly while also standardizing the development environment across your teams.

### Seed

To seed the database with a few products and pages you can run `yarn seed`. This template also comes with a `GET /api/seed` endpoint you can use to seed the database from the admin panel.

> NOTICE: seeding the database is destructive because it drops your current database to populate a fresh one from the seed template. Only run this command if you are starting a new project or can afford to lose your current data.

## Production

To run Payload in production, you need to build and serve the Admin panel. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Invoke the `payload build` script by running `yarn build` or `npm run build` in your project root. This creates a `./build` directory with a production-ready admin bundle.
1. Finally run `yarn serve` or `npm run serve` to run Node in production and serve Payload from the `./build` directory.
1. When you're ready to go live, see [Deployment](#deployment) for more details.

### Deployment

Before deploying your app, you need to:

1. Switch [your Stripe account to live mode](https://stripe.com/docs/test-mode) and update your [Stripe API keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys). See [Connect Stripe](#connect-stripe) for more details.
1. Ensure your app builds and serves in production. See [Production](#production) for more details.

The easiest way to deploy your project is to use [Payload Cloud](https://payloadcms.com/new/import), a one-click hosting solution to deploy production-ready instances of your Payload apps directly from your GitHub repo. You can also deploy your app manually, check out the [deployment documentation](https://payloadcms.com/docs/production/deployment) for full details.
